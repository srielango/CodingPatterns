# C# Coding Patterns

## Overview
This project aims to provide **C# implementations** for commonly used **coding patterns**. Each pattern includes **three difficulty levels** (Easy, Medium, Hard), with a **Naive approach** and an **optimized pattern-based approach**. The design supports multiple strategies via the **Strategy Pattern**, allowing additional approaches to be easily integrated.

A separate **MSTest project** ensures thorough testing, targeting **100% code coverage** since these patterns do not involve UI components.
